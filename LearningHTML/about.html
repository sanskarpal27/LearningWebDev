        <h2>Why Does This Page Exist?</h2>
        <p>The sole reason for the existence of this page is because im trying to learn HTML and to have perhaps a bit of a 
            productive semester break. <br> I absolutely despise my college and am disgusted by the idea of going back there.
            But I also can't stay at home for long which leaves me with no choice but to somehow go back to that place. <br>
            I just wanted to generate random text and after writing a paragraph abhi yaad aaya that i could've used lorem.
            How dumb can i be wow
